This program translates a textfile to leet text and prints the resulting text as well as word count information. It takes a filename to be translated and returns the results to stdout. Exceptions are thrown for invalid files or arguments.

To compile Make Leet:
  $ gcc -Wall -std=c11 -o makeleet makeleet.c

After compilation, use Make Leet by calling:
  $ ./makeleet <filename>

A test file is included in this package. To ensure makeleet is working, run:
 $ ./makeleet testfile
